# Khaled El Naggar – Portfolio Landing Page

This repository contains the source for Khaled El Naggar's software developer portfolio landing page. It is a single-page site built with semantic HTML, modern CSS, and a small amount of vanilla JavaScript for navigation behavior.

## Getting Started

Open `index.html` in any modern browser to explore the landing page locally. No build steps or external dependencies are required beyond an internet connection to load the Google Fonts referenced in the `<head>`.

## Structure

- `index.html` – Page markup and section content.
- `styles.css` – Global styles, layout, and responsive design rules.
- `main.js` – Mobile navigation toggle and dynamic footer year.

Feel free to customize the content, styling, and branding to make it your own.
